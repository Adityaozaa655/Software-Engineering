                <q>is used to determine the age of carbon-bearing material by measuring its levels of radiocarbon, the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Invented by Willard Libby in the late 1940s, it soon became a standard tool for archaeologists. Radiocarbon is constantly created in the atmosphere, when cosmic rays create free neutrons that hit nitrogen. Plants take in radiocarbon through photosynthesis, and animals eat the plants.</q>
